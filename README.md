Probabilistic models
====================

Collection of probabilistic models, e.g. random variables, random processes, for various physical properties.
The data are based on experiments, observations, and expert judgement. The main focus is on civil engineering and on structural reliability.
Feel free to fork this repo and to commit your additions!

Motivation
----------

The scattered data in the literature often make it hard and timeconsuming to select appropriate probabilistic models in engineering analysis.
This repo is intended to collect these probabilistic models and to provide an open platform to extend them.


Organization of data
--------------------
* Resistance
	* model uncertainty
* Action, effect
	* model uncertainty
* Geometry


Contributing to the database
----------------------------
* Select the appropriate class, e.g. resistance, action, for the new data
* Provide reference to the model
* Seek original sources (first source of data)
* Sample size, number of observations, application range of models should be briefly given in the Notes column
* Multiple sources to the same physical property are welcome
